AsWing alpha2: 
Just added many useful components.

AsWing beta1: 
1. FocusManager start works.
2. Keybord control functions added to every exist components.
3. Event handler way changed. Before, you just can receive one.

Comments of point 3:
 
parammeter with you handler method, now, the way is more similar 
to flash core api's. For example to add clickEvent to a button:
Before Beta1:
    button.addEventListener(Component.ON_CLICKED, __theHandler, this);
    ...
private function __theHandler(event:Event):Void{
	var theButton:JButton = JButton(event.getSource());
	var clickCount:Number = Number(event.clickCount);
	...
}
Now with Beta1:
    button.addEventListener(Component.ON_CLICKED, __theHandler, this);
    ...
private function __theHandler(source:JButton, clickCount:Number):Void{
	var theButton:JButton = source;
	...
}
You can see the new way is much more convenient, you dont need object casting.

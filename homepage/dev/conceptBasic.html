                        For the success of a project with ActionScript 2.0 it is necessary to integrate additional functions that are low-level in Flash.<br>
                        <br>
                        Low-level called in this connection means that many features work in a "usually not suggested" way to handle operations so that other features don't have to use these techniques.<br>
                        (for example: __proto__, constructor(), ... everything that has a connection with static stuff)

                          <li><a name="Output"></a><h2>Output handling</h2>
                            Usually, the output from an application within flash runs over <code>trace();</code>(including reports about uncaught errors). The Problem of this way is that it will only work within an environment where "trace" is supported (only the Flash environment supports this by default). All other cases (within a website, in an executeable file, etc.) don't have a standard output. The output of trace actions is not even guaranteed in the Flash environment, because their export can be switched off(and, of course back on) in the publish settings.
                            <ul>
                              <li><a name="OutputReason"></a><h3>Reason</h3>
                                We support this because we think that output is absolutely necessary(for the user as for the developer) and that it should be possible anywhere.
                              </li>
                              <li><a name="OutputSolution"></a><h3>Solution</h3>
                                To make sure that all output can be handled dynamically within any application(and any player) we create a basic bridge to access the needed functionality.<br>
                                <br>
                                This bridge should take all requests and forward it to OutputHandlers. There should be several implementations for several kinds of runntime environments.<br>
                                <br>
                                This bridge should also decide wether the current output level(for more details see below) allows the requested action. If not, it does simply nothing.
                              </li>
                              <li><a name="OutputAPI"></a><h3>API</h3>
                                All functions will be accessible through the org.as2lib.basic.Out class with the following static functions:
                                <codeorg.as2lib.basic.Out</code>
                                <ul>
                                  <li><h4>.write([String]):Void</h4>
                                    Simple string output to the standard device (comparable with trace).
                                  </li>
                                  <li><a name="OutputHandling.error"></a><h4>.error([Exception]):Void</h4>
                                    Exceptions are usually not visible within a .swf (except in the Flash MX 2004 testing environment), this method should print exceptions in a better way.
                                  </li>
                                  <li><h4>.log([String]):Void</h4>
                                    Logging often works with files and is more strict, the implementation of the Handler should choose how.
                                  </li>
                                  <li><h4>.setOutputHandler([OutputHandler]):Void</h4>
                                    Usually the "StandardOutputHandler"(which is itself implementing the OutputHandlerInterface) should process all actions, but it will be possible to write custom output handlers for specific needs/various systems.
                                  </li>
                                  <li><h4>.setOutputLevel([Number]):Void</h4>
                                    The Outputlevel defines which actions are processed and which not. It is designed as a binary flag, you may set it to:                                <pre>(0) 000 = No output.
1 = 001 = processing only exceptions.
2 = 010 = processing only logs.
4 = 100 = processing only writes..</pre>
and each combination:
<pre>(7) 111 = complete output</pre><br>
                                    In this way, it's simple to extend it. There will be constants to simplify the access:
                                    <code>.DO_EXCEPTIONS // 1
.DO_LOG // 2
.DO_WRITE // 4
.DO_EXCEPTIONS_AND_LOG // DO_EXCEPTIONS | DO_LOG
.DO_EXCEPTIONS_AND_WRITE // DO_EXCEPTIONS | DO_WRITE
.DO_LOG_AND_WRITE // DO_LOG | DO_WRITE
.DO_EVERYTHING // DO_EXCEPTIONS | DO_LOG | DO_WRITE</code>
                                  </li>
                                </ul>
                              </li>
                              <li><a name="OutputHandler"></a><h3>OutputHandler</h3>
                                Every OutputHandler must implement the OutputHandlerInterface. To provide a fundament there will be an <pre>org.as2lib.basic.outputHandler.Trace</pre> class that simply delegates every output to the trace function. Further classes may be: JavaScript OutputHandler and InScreen Outputhandler.
                              </li>
                              <li><a name="OutputExceptions"></a><h3>Exceptions</h3>
                                Exceptions will be thrown if ...
                                <ul>
                                  <li>no Exception was defined (<code>.error()</code>)</li>
                                  <li>the given String was empty (<code>.write()</code>,<code>.log()</code>)</li>
                                  <li>no OutputWriter was available (default value is a "TraceOutputWriter")</li>
                                </ul>
                              </li>
                            </ul>
                          </li>
                          <li><a name="Exception"></a><h2>Exception handling</h2>
                            Usually Exceptions within Flash get displayed with the trace(Error.toString()). The Result is very rare (if nothing defined only: "Error occured" will be displayed) This blocks exception-viewing within another environment than Flash MX 2004.
                            <ul>
                              <li><a name="ExceptionReason"></a><h3>Reason</h3>
                                The Error Class that Flash uses ist in best mind not useable. It doesn't allow you to find an error.
                              </li>
                              <li><a name="ExceptionSolution"></a><h3>Solution</h3>
                                We will provide a class that extends the basic Error class (to keep in mind that it will be better in future), with new features.
                              </li>
                              <li><a name="ExceptionNewFeatures"></a><h3>New Features</h3>
                                <ul>
                                  <li><h4>Automized name generation</h4>
                                    To stop that you will have automatically to insert an Exception name
                                    <code>class MyError extends Error {
  public var name = "org.as2lib.basic.WrongArgumentException";
}
                                    </code>
                                    we will use reflections to get automatically the name of the Exception.
                                  </li>
                                  <li><h4>Stack</h4>
                                    We will save the previous called action with vars as small implementation of a stacktrace (as long as not more is supported) with the arguments object.<br>
                                    This will save time in searching "where did this exception occur".
                                  </li>
                                  <li><h4>Exception Conversion</h4>
                                    If you want to throw an Exception on by a different type when you've catched it there will be a functionality to convert one Exception to another, of course, your are able to cast it but this doesn't change the fields and the name would be the same, you wouldn't have noticed any difference. The conversion should fill the exception additionally with the old Stacktrace and type.
                                  </li>
                                </ul>
                              </li>
                              <li><a name="ExceptionAPI"></a><h3>API</h3>
                                For using this exception it's only necessary to extend the basic class.
                                Example:<code>class org.as2lib.basic.WrongArgumentsException extends org.as2lib.basic.Exception {
}</code>, all the Rest will be done by the basic class.

                            Java has a functionality for getting a classes name, methods and properties. This is mighty for getting more informations about an instance you've got.<br>

                                The question i've heard most about this is "How the hell should this work?". There is a simple Answer: I use all scopeable areas that are available (starting with _level0 and _global), then i save all informations and step the name throught until i find the first instance, from there i will get the path. With the path and "eval" i'm able to fetch everything else.

                            Eventhandling within as2 should be a two sided sword. On the one hand it is necessary to have an easy handling for an event itself. On the other hand is generic eventhandling a problem because you can't guarantee that all event's fired reach the final client.<br>
                            <h3>Generic Eventhandling</h3>
                            For generic eventhandling there will be a (abstract) class <code>org.as2lib.basic.EventableElement extends BasicObject</code> to handle general events. This class will not have ANY public method. But this class should be based on the EventDispatcher by Macromedia.<br>
                            <br>
                            This class will provide the functionality to register and fire generic events by <code>.addEventListener(object, "event");
.removeEventListener(object, "event");</code>
                            <h3>Eventrule for Using</h3>
                            For cute Handling of this code the Workflow will have to look like this:
                            <ol>
                              <li>The Classwriter should define an Interface where all Event's are defined (how should elseway be sure that you implement Events?)
                                <code>interface MyEventInterface {
  function onClick(e:MyEventObject):Void;
  function onRelease(e:MyReleaseEventObject):Void;
}</code>
                              </li>
                              <li>The Classwriter will have to define methods to add an Object using this Events.
                                <code>class MyClass {
  public function addMyEventListener(obj:MyEventInterface) {
    this.addEventListener(obj, "onClick");
    this.addEventListener(obj, "onRelease");
  }
}</code>
                              </li>
                              <li>The User from the Code will have to take a look at the Interface.
                                <code>class MyEventListener implements MyEventInterface, AnotherEventInterface {
  public function onClick(e:MyEventObject):Void {
    // does something
  }
  public function onRelease(e:MyEventObject):Void {
    // does something different
  }
  // and other events
}</code></li>
                              <li>Then the user add's his Eventhandler to the Object
                                <code>new MyClass().addMyEventListener(new MyEventListener());</code>
                              </li>
                            </ol>
                            <h3>Why so complicated?</h3>
                            This is actually the best way to ensure that a function is really available and it finally reduces the operation speed of eventhandling by a better Code Handling.
                            Of Course this way isn't perfect. It will maybe get changed within a future worksheet by a better idea, but actually i see no different possibility.
                            <h3>Different access</h3>
                            Well, first previewable Problem will be that one class is not able to extend this Eventhandler, because it has already extended on class.
                            The simplest way to allow this way is to get an Eventhandler as instance.
                            <code>function MyClass () {
  this.eventHandler = new org.as2lib.basic.EventHandler();
}</code>
                            And the rest works as used only with "this.eventhandler.addEventListener()" instead of "this.addEventListener()". The only problem ist that we have already the abstract class, so this class has to be an own extension:<code>class org.as2lib.basic.EventHandlerUseable extends org.as2lib.basic.EventHandler /* Names not fixed */ {
  public function addHandler( ... ) {
    return(this.addEventHandler( ... ));
  }
  ... // or similar
}</code>
                            <p class="note">Note: this Issue might change a little. (naming and real functionality)</p>
                          </li>
                          <li><a name="TypedArray"></a><h2>Typed Array</h2>
                            A typical problem using as2 is that an Array might have one or more types within an Array, in most cases, this is very problematic, especially when you want to publish your classes (within a team or generally), because other people can easily create chaos when they don't watch. 
                            <h3>Where to find?</h3>
                            Of course we need a Class you will find it at org.as2lib.basic.TypedArray. This class will use the as2 Array class and uses all Methods like Array as a Bridge. It should not be possible to directly set/get a Value like <code>#
myArray = new Array();
myArray["name"] = "bunny";</code> because the Compiler would not check it. We cant prevent this (the compiler completly blows it). But at least we can bind ( by not using a dynamic class, like Array is) that <code>
myArray.name = "bunny"</code> will not work.
                            <h3>Typedefinition</h3>
                            The type of an Array should be defined within the constructor. Infact the Type should be the hole lifetime the same.<code>new TypedArray(org.as2lib.basic.Exception)</code>
                            <h3>Typeinsurance</h3>
                            We have a "not-dynamic" Class. So there must be methods for adding a value within this array with a name.
                            <ul>
                              <li>validation: <code>public function checkType(value) {
  if(value instanceof this.type) {
    return(this.type);
  } else {
    throw new org.as2lib.basic.exceptions.WrongTypeException("The given Value doesn't match to the Array's type");
  }
}</code></li>
                              <li>setting: <code>public function setValue(name:String, to) {
  this.internalArray[name] = checkType(to);
}</code></li>
                              <li>getting: <code>public function getValue(name:String) {
  return(this.internalArray[name])
}</code></li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3>Bridge Functionality</h3>
                            Even the validation and the setting/getting of values are almost simple bridge functionalities. Different Methods like "sort, push, pop, ...." can surly be simple ported.
                          </li>
                          <li><a name="Cloning"></a><h2>Cloning</h2>
                            Cloning like in Java would run with a simple Interface that defines "this class is cloneable"(this will also exist in our case). Of course this interface should be shurly used by us too but also it as2 allows us a generic clone.
                            <h3>Idea</h3>Often it's complicating that the compiler won't check all possibilities and no exceptions won't be thrown (even if the developer does really bad stuff). But it gives us the possibilty for simple using the objects constructor and proto to make a real clone with that. One &quot;for(in)&quot; loop could handle all that.                            <h3>Location</h3>
                            Of course it's basic functionality like <a href="#ReflectionHandling" title="Basically Stuff for Classhandling with Reflections">Reflections</a> so this should be also in the "BasicClass" that all other extend as ".clone()" Method.
                            <h3>Access points</h3>
                            The code/handling should be in a Util class &quot;org.as2lib.basic.Helper&quot;(or something like that)
                            <h3>Complete cloning</h3>
                            Sometimes it is a real problem that cloning only clones one level. There should be additionally a Method to clone the complete tree &quot;.cloneComplete&quot; which is defined as &quot;Chain of Responsibility&quot; (Design Pattern) this simply uses &quot;.cloneComplete&quot; recursivly (okay it's a little more difficult).
                            <p class="note">Note: Interfaces (specially small one) make problems with casting, therefore this won't be available within an interface.</p>
                          </li>
                          <li><a name="Overloading"></a><h2>Overloading</h2>
                            Of course we all should avoid overloading as good as possible, it's not beautiful that as2 doesn't support it but its logical and we have all to live with it. The "standard-way" of using overloading is pretty ugly combined with a lot of if's and code. So we decided to support this feature.
                            <h3>Target</h3>
                            Maybe the future presets for us a as2 that supports overloading, but not now. But we should be prepared for that, so each possibility should be defined in its own function:
                            <code>public function doSomethingWay1() {
}
public function doSomethingWay2() {
}</code>
                            In this case it will be nice in future to change it to a supported overloading. The second thing is that this can be well documented. But this means a Separation for this overloading would look like this:
                            <code>public function doSomething() {
  if(arguments[0] instanceOf Home) {
    doSomethingWay1(arguments[0], arguments[1]);
  } else {
    doSomethingWay2(arguments[0]);
  }
}</code>
                            This is everytime a new challenge for the developer and may cause a lot of problems. Because if you want to check all you have unreadable code, a source for errors and maybe unchecked causes (what if the arguments don't match any case?!). Here is where we want to bring our part into the game. We should provide a functionality that handles these switch automatically. This functionality should be provide the same way like the Reflections: within the basic class and as util. There you should only use a predefined method for that:
                            <code>public function doSomething() {
  overload (
    arguments,
    createOverloadHandler([String, Number], "doSomethingWay1"),
    createOverloadHandler([String], "doSomethingWay2")
  );
}</code>
                            <p class="note">Note: This is not the final code! The Syntax might change!<br>
                            Note 2: "this." Keyword is not important, it will be set by the compiler.<br>
                            Note 3: createOverloadHandler returns an OverloadHandler Instance from the Utils Class.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Wrong calls</h3>
                            A wrong call is a wrong call if it's size and it's types have no match. In this case, an exception will be thrown.
                            <h3>Public Access</h3>
                            The public Access over the Util Class will look like:<code>import org.as2lib.basic.BasicUtil;
 ...
 public function doSomething() {
   BasicUtil.overload (
     this,
     arguments,
     BasicUtil.createOverloadHandler([String, Number], "doSomethingWay1"),
     BasicUtil.createOverloadHandler([String], "doSomethingWay2")
   );
 }</code>So the complete Handling will work even if the basic Class can't be extended.
                           <h3>Possible Extension</h3>
                           There could be a possible Extension to insert Wildcards where an (un)-limited part of vars from a type can follow. (future release)

                          <li><a name="TestCases"></a><h2>Test Cases</h2>
                            After a lot discussion we decided to use our own test system instead of the <a href="http://www.as2unit.org" title="Testcases by iteration:two">as2unit</a>, specially because they use components and don't support a lot of methods.
                            <h3>What are Testcases</h3>
                            A Testcase is a Class/Method that checks a different method if it works correctly. A Developer has to write a Testcase alone for his class, a Testcase system has to provide the functionality for automated testing
                            <h3>What we do like other systems</h3>
                            We have (like all other System too) a basic Class that should be extended. This class will support different functionalities to compare values and define wether a testcase failed or not (for example: assertEquals(), assertTrue() etc.). For all this functionality there should be a inverse functionality to check the difference (example: assertNotEquals(), assertFalse(), etc.).<br>Usually a TestcaseSystem works with overloading, but in fact, we decided to use this as rare as posible so each method should have an additional method to provide a message to the failure (for example: assertTrueWithMessage(), assertFalseWithMessage(), etc.). <p class="note">Note: with as2unit you have also to make different notations to the testcase itself, we will avoid this.</p>
                            <h3>Running Code</h3>
                            To run Testcases you should not have to do two different things(as as2unit has). Developers should be able to start a testcase within a call(not add a whole component to the stage). This should work with &lt;basicClass&gt;.run(&quot;&lt;path&gt;&quot;) this way is usual and simple but within flash it doesn't compile the testcase if you use a string. So we will provide a second access to run a testcase seperatly with &lt;basicClass&gt;.runClass(&lt;path&gt;) so the Class itself will be compiled because it is defined as is within the call.
                            <h3>Handling Output</h3>
                            The Output Handling should run over the standard OutputHandling. Simple Text Output to Asccii graphics. Another difference to other testsystems should be defined by displaying more details within the result (like which testcases were found and which work correctly), mostly because it's often not clear whether a testcase is found or not.

                          <li><a name="RegExp"></a><h2>Regulary Expressions</h2>
                            Regulary Expression might count to the StringUtils but in my opinion Regulary Expressions can handle a lot and improve the work well, so i put it to the Basic Concept.<br>
                            <h3>What are Regulary Expressions?</h3>
                            Regulary Expressions are a simple but mighty way to search within Strings. JavaScript supports Regulary Expressions well and i got no idea why flash not.
                            <h3>How will they be supported?</h3>
                            Support will come within a Util Class. One Accesspoint (at least) will handle a Regulary Expression. Further details will come during real concept and Worksheet for this.

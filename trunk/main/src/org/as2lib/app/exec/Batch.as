import org.as2lib.app.exec.Process;

/**
 * {@code Batch} runs multiple processes (most batches run one process after each
 * other).
 * 
 * <p>Use the {@link #addProcess} method to add a new child-process to this batch.
 * Most implementations run processes in the order they get added to them.
 * 
 * <p>This interface extends the {@code Process} interface. This means that this
 * batch is a composite, so you can add one batch with the {@code addProcess}
 * method as child-process to another batch.
 * 
 * <p>Besides the listeners provided by processes batchs normally also support the
 * following listeners: {@link BatchStartListener}, {@link BatchFinishListener},
 * {@link BatchUpdateListener} and {@link BatchErrorListener}.
 * 
 * <p>Example:
 * <code>
 *   import org.as2lib.app.exec.Batch;
 *   import org.as2lib.app.exec.BatchProcess;
 *   
 *   var batch:Batch = new BatchProcess();
 *   batch.addListener(new MyStartUpController());
 *   batch.addProcess(new MyStartUpProcess());
 *   batch.addProcess(new MyXMLParsingProcess());
 *   batch.start();
 * </code>

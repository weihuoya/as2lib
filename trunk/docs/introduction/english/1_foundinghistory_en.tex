The {\sl as2lib}, an \emph{Open Source} {\sl ActionScript 2} Library, was founded in September 2003 as a project to create better programming possibilities for {\sl ActionScript 2}. The project team deals with core problems of Flash and tries to solve daily problems while programming with Flash.
One of the most important characteristics is that {\sl as2lib} is published under the \emph{MPL} (Mozilla Public License). That means free usage in private as well as commercial projects. After the definition of programming guidelines and the basic concept, the work on the separate packages was set about by five project members.
